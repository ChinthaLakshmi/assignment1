            Paris (English: /ˈpærɪs/; French pronunciation: ​[paʁi] (listen)) is the capital and most populous city of
            France, with an official estimated population of 2,102,650 residents as of 1 January 2023[2] in an area of
            more than 105 km2 (41 sq mi),[5] making it the fourth-most populated city in the European Union as well as
            the 30th most densely populated city in the world in 2022.[6] Since the 17th century, Paris has been one of
            the world's major centres of finance, diplomacy, commerce, culture, fashion, gastronomy and many areas. For
            its leading role in the arts and sciences, as well as its early and extensive system of street lighting, in
            the 19th century, it became known as "the City of Light".

            FAVOURITE FOOD : IDLY

        <p>
            Idli or idly (/ɪdliː/ (listen)) (plural: idlis) is a type of savoury rice cake, originating from South
            India,
            popular as a breakfast food in Southern India and in Sri Lanka. The cakes are made by steaming a batter
            consisting of fermented black lentils (de-husked) and rice. The fermentation process breaks down the
            starches so
            that they are more readily metabolised by the body.

            Idli has several variations, including rava idli, which is made from semolina. Regional variants include
            sanna
            of Konkan.
